COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python
Danny Godwin

..

For this project, I used the COVID19 dataset published by John Hopkins University that consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country. We have another dataset titled the "World Happiness Report" which consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are. This project is based on the guided teaching method provided by Coursera and incorporates the following modules: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplot.
