COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python
Danny Godwin

..

For this project, I used the COVID19 dataset published by John Hopkins University that consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country. We have another dataset titled the "World Happiness Report" which consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are. This project is based on the guided teaching method provided by Coursera and incorporates the following modules: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplot.

..

Task 1: Importing COVID19 dataset
Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

Task 2: Finding a good Measure
Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.

Task 3: Importing World happiness report dataset
Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.

Task 4: Visualizing the results
Visualize our results using Seaborn.
